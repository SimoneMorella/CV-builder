## How it works?
ResuMe.cv is divided in two major parts.
The first is a set of input well designed from a UX prespective, used to
insert Personal Data, Contacts, Education and Experience data, etc.
While the second part is a preview of the Resume that changes everytime the input part
get updated. 
Additionally you can add a profile picture, other than a set of skills that you find important.
**IMPORTANT**
To see an example of the CV full of sample data use the second button on the top of the first box (Title box).
To Download the CV as a pdf after you insert your data use the first button on the top of the first box. (PDF Icon).

## Info about development
This project was completely developed with the React.js library.
Vite was used for the setup and TailwindCSS for the styling.
The website is completely responsive and it was debugged through the Pixel 7 for any front-end bug.
Neverthless it should work perfectly on any device and any layout.
It is adviced to built your CV through this website from a laptop or a desktop pc as personally
I think it manage the layout in the best way due to the crowdness of the input part.
Also, there is a huge usage of react component library as **react-tooltip** and **react-select**.

This project was made for practice with React components, props and States.
